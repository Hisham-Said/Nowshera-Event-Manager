The frontend communicates with the FastAPI backend through REST API endpoints. The backend handles authorization, business rules, and database operations.

## 🚀 Running Locally

### Frontend

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Backend

Start the FastAPI development server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The backend uses a local SQLite database stored at `FastAPI/events.db`, so Supabase credentials are not required.

Install backend dependencies and start it with:

```bash
cd FastAPI
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

To create an administrator automatically on first startup, set `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, and optionally `ADMIN_NAME` before starting FastAPI. The database can be moved with `SQLITE_DB_PATH`, and `TOKEN_SECRET` should be set to a private value outside local development.
